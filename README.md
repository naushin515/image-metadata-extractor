# image-metadata-extractor
A simple web app to extract and display EXIF metadata (like date, GPS, and camera info) from uploaded images.
Every digital photo contains hidden information called metadata — details about how and where the image was taken. This includes the camera model, capture date, exposure settings, and sometimes GPS coordinates. The Image Metadata Extractor reads these embedded details and presents them in a clear, readable format.
# How It Runs 
Click “Click to select an image” to upload a photo (JPG, JPEG, or PNG).
The app automatically scans the file and displays all available metadata such as:
Capture date and time
Camera settings (ISO, aperture, shutter speed, focal length)
GPS location (with a link to Google Maps if coordinates exist)
You can download the extracted information as a text report or clear the data to upload another image
